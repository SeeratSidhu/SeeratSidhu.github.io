                    I could define myself through a lot of adjectives: considerate, kind, overthinker, anxious, mostly serious, occasionally silly,  and about a hundred more. Although most of the Harry Potter quizes put me in Gryffindor, I actually want to be a Ravenclaw.

                    Why I decided to be a Full Stack Developer? Web developers get a chance to make people's life easier one app at a time while being able to let their creative juices flow and enjoying their work. Programming gives them the freedom to bring their projects to reality either independently or as part of an organization. I hope to soon call myself a Web Developer as well. Soon!
